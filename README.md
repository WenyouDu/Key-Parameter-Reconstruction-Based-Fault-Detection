# Key-Parameter Reconstruction Based Fault Detection Technology for Aircraft Hydraulic Actuation Systems
## Project Introduction
Given the scarcity and high acquisition cost of fault samples in aircraft hydraulic actuation systems, anomaly detection techniques independent of historical fault data have received significant attention. However, the inherent complex nonlinear coupling among system dynamic variables severely constrains the accuracy of conventional methods. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fault detection method based on key parameter reconstruction, which integrates physical mechanisms with data-driven approaches. By establishing input-output mapping relationships that characterize core system capabilities, the method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of key states and constructs a high-sensitivity feature set. The main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) A mechanism-causality-driven modeling criterion is established. Through the analysis of system mechanisms, input-output variable pairs characterizing core system capabilities are selected. 2) An enhanced long short-term memory (ELSTM) network is proposed to identify the nonlinear dynamic model. This network reconstructs key parameters and generates multi-dimensional residual sequences. 3) An Optimized cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm incorporating nonlinear energy and differential weighting is introduced. By constructing composite statistics, a nonlinear decision boundary that forms a tight envelope around normal data is generated. Consequently, nonstationary noise is effectively suppressed, and the detection capability for incipient parametric drifts is significantly enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the nonlinear boundary generated by this method exhibits excellent data enveloping characteristics, and its fault detection performance is significantly superior to existing benchmark models, verifying the detection effectiveness of the proposed framework under complex operating conditions.
